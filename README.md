# Computer_Vision_Extended_SRGAN
How to run the code:
1. Make sure you have your own checkpoints path to save the model weights
2. Make sure the dataset downloaded for testing has the path which is your local computer path
3. You first need to run the base model or final model in any sequence and the weights for that model will be saved to your local checkpoint path specified.
4. After the weights are saved, you need to run the Evaluation for base and final model file to get the evaluatuion, performance and results.
